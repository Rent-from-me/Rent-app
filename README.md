# RENT FORM ME
Renter From Me: like AirBnB, but for high-end electronics. Are you tired of paying ridiculous fees for camera and other equipment rentals? Bypass the middleman and rent from a real person!
## The MVP of this project is 

>1. Two user types: owners and renter
>2. user can login and create a profile
>3. user can then setup items they have for rent such as cameras, TV's, party equipment such as speakers/fog machines, etc.
>4. user will be able to create, read, update and delete rental data. A second user can login and see items that users have for rent and ask to rent an item
## Stretch
>- Add a payment option into the application allowing a user to pay over Paypal / Stripe etc. to rent their items
>- Be able to schedule a time and place for pick-up
>- Add a review system into the app so that the social aspect is there to ensure that users are legitimate.
### `npm start`

- First item
- Second item
- Third item
- Fourth item
### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
