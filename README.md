# RENT FORM ME

Renter From Me: like AirBnB, but for high-end electronics. Are you tired of paying ridiculous fees for camera and other equipment rentals? Bypass the middleman and rent from a real person!
## The MVP of this project is 

>1. Two user types: owners and renter
>2. user can login and create a profile
>3. user can then setup items they have for rent such as cameras, TV's, party equipment such as speakers/fog machines, etc.
>4. user will be able to create, read, update and delete rental data. A second user can login and see items that users have for rent and ask to rent an item


## Stretch


>- Add a payment option into the application allowing a user to pay over Paypal / Stripe etc. to rent their items
>- Be able to schedule a time and place for pick-up
>- Add a review system into the app so that the social aspect is there to ensure that users are legitimate.
